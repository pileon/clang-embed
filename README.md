# clang-embed
A simplified interface for the Clang and LLVM libraries, to create a dynamic embeddable C interpreter

This project is just in a very prototypical state, and more of an idea than anything else.

The goal is to have a simple C++ interface to embed a full C or C++ interpreter into ones own application. There should also be C-bindings.
